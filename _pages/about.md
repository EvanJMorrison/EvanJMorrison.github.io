I’m Evan J. Morrison, a molecular biologist interested in how cells control protein fate through
translation-coupled quality control and the ubiquitin–proteasome system. My work focuses on
N-terminal processing and N-degron pathways, including how specific N-terminal residue features
are generated and recognized to regulate turnover.

I earned my Ph.D. in Molecular Biology & Biochemistry at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus,
and I’m currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research.

On this site you can find selected papers, projects, and ways to get in touch.
